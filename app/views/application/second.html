    <p class="apple">Steve Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955. Job's parents <br>were two University of Wisconsin graduate students. Unfortunately they gave him up for <br> adoption, leaving Jobs smart but directionless. Jobs experimented with different pursuits<br>  before starting Apple Computers with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Apple's revolutionary <br> products include the iPod, iPhone and iPad. They are now seen as dictating the evolution <br> of modern technology. He died in 2011, following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>
